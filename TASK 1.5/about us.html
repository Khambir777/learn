        <h2>1.A London independent bike shop & framebuilder</h2>
        <p>In 1921, the first shop of F.W. Evans Cycles opened on the Kennington Road in south east London. Trading from this site for thirty years, F.W Evans Cycles built up a strong reputation as a quality cycle shop. It became particularly well known for building its own frames and bikes, earning an award from the Cyclists Touring Club (CTC) for ‘The greatest improvement in cycle design, construction or equipment during the year 1925’.</p>
        <p>The business was purchased by Joseph Smith in the 1950s. At the time, the shop sold a range of cycles and toys, but during the seventies Joseph handed the business on to his son, Gary Smith, who developed the shop into a specialist cycle retailer.</p>
        <p>After more than 50 years of trading at Kennington Road, re-development of the site saw the store relocated to The Cut in Waterloo in 1977, where the shop continues to trade today. Indeed the latest re-incarnation of that original Waterloo Cut store recently won the Retail Week Enterprise Award for Store Design of the Year in 2013.</p>
        <p>During the 1990s, Gary worked with Mike Rice, then the Croydon store franchise owner, to reunite all the previously franchised stores under the umbrella of F.W. Evans Cycles (UK) Ltd. During this time, the Evans Cycles Mail Order catalogue was launched, enabling Evans Cycles to supply a wider range of products to a much larger audience. This major innovation required the opening of a central distribution centre, which was established in Leatherhead, Surrey. Within a few years, the growth of a new type of retailing – eCommerce - led to the Evans Cycles website also being launched.</p>

        <h2>2.A national independent, specialist retailer</h2>
        <p>As the established stores began to go from strength to strength so did the popularity of cycling. This gave Evans Cycles the confidence to expand further, opening two more stores in West London, (West End and Holborn) in 2001.
        </p>
        <p>The business continued to prosper and soon out-grew its original distribution centre in Leatherhead, relocating to a distribution centre of 50,000 square feet in Gatwick, Sussex, which is still the company’s base today (although this has now grown to 125,000 square feet with further plans for expansion on the horizon!)
        </p>
        <p>With a large and modern distribution centre in place, the company was able to expand more rapidly and opened between two or three stores each year until 2006 when the company opened a record six stores. In 2004 Evans Cycles tested the water with a store location outside of its core “heartland” of the South East of England – in Castleford (near Leeds), Yorkshire.
        </p>
        <p>The success of that store led to Evans Cycles going well and truly national so that today we have over 50 stores located around the UK from Glasgow to Plymouth</p>
        <p>The business invested in systems to grow its eCommerce operation, and now provides leading edge multi-channel services – including the ability to ‘Click and Collect’ in any store nationwide.</p>
        <p>Launched in October 2006, our own Pinnacle brand offers a range of bikes which have proved extremely popular with our core customers. The FWE brand of accessories and parts was introduced in 2013.</p>
        <p>In 2013 we were also pleased to launch the exclusive HOY bikes range; working in collaboration with Olympic champion Sir Chris Hoy to design and develop an exciting collection of road, commuter and track bikes. This range continues to evolve and grow, most recently adding ‘proper’ children’s bikes to the collection.</p>

        <h2>3.Our Values</h2>
        <p>We are a progressive business, excited to look to the future and introduce innovations both in terms of what we are able to offer our customers, and how the company is run</p>
        <p>We have 3 core values that help to inform and guide us:</p>
        <h4>1.Sharing Our Passion</h4>
        <p>We believe that riding a bike really is one of life’s great pleasures and are always passionate and enthusiastic to our customers. We pride ourselves on our bike knowledge, but will always be accessible and friendly to new riders.</p>
        
        <h4>2.Quality Makes It Better</h4>
        <p>We will always strive to offer a high quality customer experience and strongly believe that quality products help you get more joy from riding. We believe that quality advice should be available to all cyclists and will always measure our quality by asking ‘would you recommend us to a friend?'
        </p>
        <h4>3.Doing What’s Right</h4>
        We only sell products and services we believe in and act with honesty and integrity at all times. We’ll do everything possible to help our customers with a problem and will treat others as we expect to be treated ourselves.
        <h2>4.Our Stores</h2>
        <p>Our stores are the heart and soul of our company. The majority of our store colleagues are enthusiastic cyclists themselves, and extensive training ensures the highest levels of technical ability and knowledge. We pride ourselves on giving customers the right information to make informed decisions about their cycle and accessory purchases.</p>
        <p>Our award winning stores are a haven for cyclists. They are the place where you can test ride any of our bikes. They all offer a full range of service and repair facilities as well as a wide selection of bikes, parts, accessories and clothing and all the stores can order you any of the vast selection of products available on our website for next day delivery or collection.
        </p>

        <h2>5.Our Gatwick Campus</h2>

The site has a large trade counter stocking all products available through Evans Cycles, which can be called down from our warehouses, plus a workshop where bikes are built and inspected prior to being dispatched to customers.</p>
<p>All central support functions operate from the Gatwick Campus. This includes Accounts, Human Resources, Customer Service, Design, Marketing, Buying & Merchandising, eCommerce, Ride-to-Work, Finance, IT and Estate Management.
